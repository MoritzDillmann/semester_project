# Dapp to send ETH across Metamask wallets using QR codes
<p> This Dapp constitutes a simple programme to send and receive ether (ETH) across Metamask wallets using QR codes. </p>

<p> Author: Moritz Dillmann <br>
Institution: University of Lausanne </p>

## Motivation: 
<p> Proof of concept for a consumer CO2 compensation loyalty programme. </p>

##  Language requirements:
1) Backend: Solidity (Ethereum)
2) API: Javascript (web3 package)
3) Frontend: HTML, Javascript

## Environments:
1) Smart contract development: Remix (http://remix.ethereum.org/)
2) Smart contract deployment: Truffle (https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
3) Smart contract testing: Ganache GUI (and -cli) (https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
4) Smart contract/ Dapp interaction in the browser: Metamask (https://metamask.io/)

<p> "MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with dapps in a browser. It is an extension for Chrome or Firefox that connects to an Ethereum network without running a full node on the browser's machine. It can connect to the main Ethereum network, any of the testnets (Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby), or a local blockchain such as the one created by Ganache or Truffle Develop."

## Getting started:

## 1. Backend

### Create a Truffle project
1. Install node.js (v14.17.0) and npm (v6.14.13) <br>
https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Install Truffle: 
`npm install truffle -g` <br>
https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle

3. Create a new Truffle project:
`truffle init` <br>
(You can check all commands you can use with Truffle with: `truffle`)

### Smart contract development
1. Create Smart Contracts in _.contracts/_ folder: <br>
`cd contracts` <br>
`truffle create contract Trust.sol` <br>
‚Äî> creates a new Solidity file in the contracts/ directory

2. Edit Smart Contract in your favourite Code Editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code). <br>
 I created the smart contract for this Dapp, "Trust.sol", in Remix: http://remix.ethereum.org/. Remix allows you to test your contracts functionality before you deploy it in your project.

### Migrate your smart contract
1. navigate to the _./migrations_ folder: <br>
`ls migrations/` <br>
Don‚Äôt modify the already existing migration file, Truffle needs it to use its migration feature.

2. create a migration file: 
`truffle create migration Trust` <br>

 Truffle adds a random number to the name of your new migration file in order to know in what order it has to run the migration.

3. 	Modify your new migration file in your text editor:
	1. copy the content from the _1_initial_migration.js_ file <br>
    2. then modify it a bit: <br>

    3. First, we require our smart contract of interest:

    `var Trust = artifacts.require("./Trust.sol");` <br>

    4. Here, we have our deployer (function) which calls the method 'deploy': <br>

    ```
    module.exports = function(deployer) {
        deployer.deploy(Trust, "This is my message")}; 
    ```

    This deploys the Trust.sol smart contract. 
    The smart contract is supposed to say the random string "This is my message" after its deployed.


### Start a local blockchain with Ganache
1. Install Ganache GUI 
https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache

2. Install Ganache-cli
`npm install -g ganache-cli`

3. Start Ganache CLI from the command line (in a separate Terminal tab)
`truffle develop` <br>
‚Äî> this command starts a local test net <br>
‚Äî> we now also have an interactive prompt with which we can interact with our smart contract.

2. Start Ganache GUI (i.e. the visual tool)
`open -a Ganache`

3. Configure Ganache GUI (to work with the Ganache-cli)

    1. Go to Settings in Ganache GUI
	2. Change the Port Number to 9545 (this is the port number of the blockchain the Ganache-cli instance started).
    3. Change the seed phrase: 
        1. Go to ‚ÄúAccounts & Keys‚Äù Menu.
        2. Insert the Mnemonic Seed phrase that was generated when you started Ganache CLI in the Terminal.
    4. Restart Ganache GUI

<p> Everything is now synced and up to date! üßû </p>
<p> Ganache GUI automatically handles the mining of the blocks, so you do not have to care about it. Convenient! <br> 
With each transaction, Ganache shows you the Gas that was used to pay for the mining.</p>

### Deploy your smart contract to the local blockchain

1. In the Ganache-cli terminal tab, type:
`migrate`

### Make a first interaction with your smart contract
1. create a variable (in the Ganache Terminal tab) that points to the deployed smart contract 
`var inst;` <br>
The Terminal should return "undefined"

2. Then type: 
`Trust.deployed().then((instance) => {inst = instance;});` <br>

<p> When we now write the name of our variable, it should point to our smart contract: </p>

`inst;`

## API
<p> In a next step, we connect web3.js to our Truffle project. <br>
web3.js is a commonly used Ethereum Javascript API. <br>
For details about the web3 library collection, look at the 
<a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/#:~:text=Ethereum%20JavaScript%20API-,web3.,using%20HTTP%2C%20IPC%20or%20WebSocket.&text=js%20as%20well%20as%20providing%20an%20API%20reference%20documentation%20with%20examples">docs</a>.










## Future steps: 

Connect to a public testnet like Ropsten or Kovan using a public API service for Ethereum from 'Infura' (instead of running an Ethereum node yourself)

This allows users to:
1. receive a transaction request from Web3
2. sign the transaction request in their wallet (e.g. Metamask)

Only after it received the signed transaction from the user's wallet, Web3 sends the signed transaction to the Ethereum network via the Infura node.

Btw:
When you use Metamask, you _do not have to set up Infura_ (for public testnets), because Metamask takes care by itself of how to send transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.
